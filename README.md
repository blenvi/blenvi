# Blenvi

A modern monorepo built with Turborepo, featuring multiple applications and shared packages.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `api`: a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) backend API
- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web application with Supabase integration
- `docs`: a [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/) documentation site
- `storybook`: a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) component library
- `native`: a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) mobile app (Expo)
- `@repo/ui`: a shared React component library using shadcn/ui
- `@repo/eslint-config`: shared `eslint` configurations
- `@repo/typescript-config`: shared `tsconfig.json` configurations

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```

## üöÄ Deployment

This monorepo is configured for deployment on Render with support for multiple services.

üìñ **[Read the Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for detailed instructions on deploying to Render.

üîç **[Quick Reference Guide](./RENDER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** for common commands and configurations.

### Quick Deploy

1. Connect your GitHub repository to [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Create a new Blueprint
3. Select your repository - Render will detect `render.yaml`
4. Configure environment variables
5. Click "Apply" to deploy all services

Each service will deploy independently with:

- **Root directory** configuration for monorepo support
- **Build filters** to avoid unnecessary deploys
- **Automatic deployments** on push to main branch

## üåç Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` files in each app directory and configure with your own values:

```bash
# For web app
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# For API
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

See individual app directories for required environment variables.
